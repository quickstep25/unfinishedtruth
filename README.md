## Overview
This repository serves two purposes:
- **Website Project** — Source code and build pipeline for my personal site, built with Parcel, PUG templates, and Sass.
- **Experimentation** — A space for practicing and refining Azure DevOps pipelines, automation, and deployment workflows.

## Description
This project also contains material for *The Unfinished Truth*, a personal memoir created as both a narrative and a factual statement.  
It is formatted like a story but serves as a tool to provide historical fact, based on lived experience and memory.
